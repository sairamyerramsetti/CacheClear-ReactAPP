# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

once App started and update package.json and verify the UI. You should be able to view cache cleared success message.

Testing purpose I have commented, window.location.reload in helper.js but for deployment we need this line.
